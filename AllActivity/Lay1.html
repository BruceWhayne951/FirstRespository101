    <h1 style="color: red;">BERSERK</h1>
    <p>Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series created by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe–inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the Band of the Hawk. The series follows Guts' journey seeking revenge on Griffith, who betrayed him and the rest of their comrades. Berserk is a dark fantasy story following Guts, a mercenary warrior known as the Black Swordsman, who is on a path of vengeance against Griffith and the God Hand, demonic beings who orchestrated a horrific ritual called the Eclipse, sacrificing Guts' former comrades, the Band of the Hawk, to transform Griffith into a demonic entity and trapping Guts' lover, Casca, in a state of madness.  The story, set in a brutal, fictionalized medieval Europe, explores themes of good versus evil, loss, friendship, and the dark aspects of human nature, all depicted through Guts' constant struggle against demons and his own inner darkness. </p>
